# Routing-project introduction
The goal of this challenging project is to create an application that renders out all of the data from the API. This API contains data on users, comments, posts, and todos. Also, this project includes actions and forms to allow users to filter, create, and edit posts. 

## Project details
Main features:
- Added loading spinner that shows while the data is being fetched.
- Add a 404 error page that still shows the navbar, but renders a 404 error message inside the content area.
- Created Edit Post page that renders out a form that allows the user to edit an existing post.
- Added  filter to the Posts page that allows the user to filter the posts by a query and the user that wrote the post.
- Form validations on the New Post and Edit Post pages.
